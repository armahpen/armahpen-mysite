Create a space-themed interactive layout for a portfolio website with a dark galaxy background.

Centerpiece: a glowing orb labeled Evans (Heavans), acting as the sun or energy source.

Surrounding this core, animate several small sci-fi spaceships or satellites orbiting in smooth circular paths—each representing a key area of my work and identity.

When a user hovers or taps a spaceship, it should gently stop and zoom in to show a card or modal with details (title + description + CTA).

Add subtle star particles in the background for a space vibe. Use glow effects, soft shadows, and motion trails for a cinematic feel.
