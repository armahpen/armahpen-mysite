1. Being you is different
   No one is perfect
   Simply you No effects
   Show dem you reflect

2. I live
   I die
   I live again
   His lost became my gain
   On the cross He endured my pain

   I live
   I die
   I live again
   Cos death He over came

3. In strokes and hues, the passions start,
   A canvas whispers from the heart,
   A symphony of colors, transformed through masterful art.

4. Hey there, I couldn’t help but notice you standing there.
   Hey there, your smile and energy are beyond compare.
   Hey there, I think we could make an awesome pair.
   Hey there, I’d love to get to know you and your flair.
   Hey there, maybe we could grab a drink or a bite to share.
   Hey there, let’s start a friendship that’s rare and so sincere.

5. Together we laugh, sometimes we stumble,
   A group of friends, a perfect jumble.
   In silly moments, our words may fumble,
   But in our hearts, love’s never humble.
   Through thick and thin, we stand as one,
   A friendship forged, never undone.

6. With dreams to chase, we dare to propel,
   In every step, our spirits swell.
   Together, we break the chains that quell,
   Rising above, where heroes dwell.
   Empowerment’s fire, in us, excels.

7. In the air, a pulsing vibe, we ride,
   Harmonic waves, side by side.
   Through the rhythm, souls collide,
   A dance of energy, amplified.
   In this space, our hearts reside,
   United by the beat, we’re sanctified

8. In realms of boundless imagination, I roam,
   Where colors dance and words find their home.
   A canvas, a page, a symphony’s embrace,
   Creativity’s fire, an eternal grace.
   From whispered dreams to bold inventions,
   I weave my thoughts with daring intentions.
   Unleashing ideas, unchained and free,
   Creativity, the essence of me.
   With every stroke, a story unfolds,
   A melody composed, a masterpiece untold.
   In realms of boundless imagination, I soar,
   Creativity’s muse, forever I adore.

9. Blood Saved
   Blood Saved even when we run from your embrace
   Your love outwit us in the race
   Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s
   But thank God for Jesus
   Cos his love freed us
   Even when we betrayed like Judas.
   Judah’s conquering Lion
   The only light brightening Zoin
   He heals, He's Gilead's balm, He save see the nails in his palm,
   If he is in the boat the storm will be calm,
   As you are Christ bids you to come
   O you should see in Heaven
   Angels clapping, they wings flapping,
   singing Hallelujah Amen

10. Coding can be quite demanding
    Errors here and there are commanding
    But once you debug and get it right
    The feeling is truly out of sight
    For coders, it’s a constant delight
